                <p class="intro-text">
                    In the vast tapestry of life, friendships are the golden threads that add warmth, color, and meaning to our days. Over the past 10 years, you have been more than just a friend—you've been my confidant, my partner in every crazy plan, my constant source of laughter, and a pillar of unshakeable support. Through bright mornings and the darkest nights, through victories and struggles, our bond has only grown stronger, deeper, and more precious.
                    <br><br>
                    I still remember the first day we met—how you changed classes, came in with that fresh energy, and how we ended up on the last bench together. That simple moment started a journey filled with fights, fun, understanding, and unforgettable memories. Nothing can replace those days. Even in my darkest moments, you were the light that guided me, with your confidence and unwavering support.
                    <br><br>
                    There were times when I realized just how much you meant to me. Even if I scored well or succeeded in something, I would always wait eagerly for your results. And when you succeeded, I felt a happiness far greater than my own. That's when I understood something important—your victories felt like mine. So chase every dream, work for yourself, and go claim every victory life has to offer… because your success brings joy to my heart too.
                    <br><br>
                    But lately, something feels different—a missing piece, maybe time, maybe conversations, maybe just a quiet distance that neither of us intended. I'm trying to figure it out on my own. Sometimes it even feels like an imposter syndrome inside me.Try understanding me and I will be absolutley fine.
                    <br><br>
                    So listen… don't worry about me. Go ahead and lead the coming years with love, joy, and success—whether I'm beside you or cheering from afar. Just know this: no matter where life takes us, I'll always be there for you, in triumph and in disaster.
